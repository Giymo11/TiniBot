Tini is back!
==================

This is a little discord Bot, aiming to be gimmicky and fun. No serious features allowed here!


Setup
-----

1. [Download Typesafe Activator](http://typesafe.com/platform/getstarted)
2. Extract the zip and run the `activator` or `activator.bat` script from a non-interactive shell
3. Your browser should open to the Activator UI: [http://localhost:8888](http://localhost:8888)

or

1. Simply use IntelliJ to import the project from SBT source model. I just wanted to give activator a try.
